# Introduction

This repository is for experimentation. Therefore, we do not plan to add any features or deal with any bugs.

# Problem

Craft does not develop Android applications. If you want to browse the Craft documentation from Android, you will need to browse Craft on the web through your browser.

# Solution

Viewing Craft through a browser is quite tedious.   
So I created an app that just displays Craft in a WebView.
